# Pinned tool manifest (minimal)
# Update these values explicitly when upgrading the toolchain

gcc: 12.x
clang: 13.x
make: 4.3
binutils: 2.39

# Notes:
# - CI installs and validates these tool versions per workflow steps in .github/workflows/ci.yml
# - Library/runtime versions used by modules should be pinned in their own manifests (e.g., Cargo.toml, requirements.txt) when relevant.
